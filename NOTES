- will py, ruby etc. need these additions too? 

  maybe expose some C API to make a common place to add stuff like this

  could call it suffix rather then filename

- alternative: pass the whole filename down in option_string, savers parse
  again with filename_split

- PPM saver as well

- no, option_string is alreadyed used by "thumbnail", we need a new stabdard
  arg to detect and set ... how about "string_arguments"

  need to add this to ForeignSave so buffer and target can see it

  hide from introspection? eg. tag as DEPRECATED

- nope, also fails, since py calls

	pointer = vips_lib.vips_filename_get_options(format_string)
        options = _to_string_copy(pointer)

        pointer = vips_lib.vips_foreign_find_save_target(format_string)
        if pointer == ffi.NULL:
            raise Error('unable to write to target')
        name = _to_string(pointer)

        return pyvips.Operation.call(name, self, target,
                                     string_options=options, **kwargs)

  ie. the filename part is stripped before we see it

  we'd need to change pyvips too, and it would need to detect older libvipses

- could add an extra string param to vips_lib.vips_filename_get_options()?

	vips_lib.vips_filename_get_options("x.y[arg=val]")

  could yield

	[arg=val,suffix=.y]

  ie. append a magic extra arg we make

  how fragile and ugly!

- something in pytest is taking FOREVER ... find it and fix it

  uses enough memory to kill the laptop

    heifsave is incredibly slow
		
      is it testing AVIF too?
