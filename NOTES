- will py, ruby etc. need these additions too? 

  maybe expose some C API to make a common place to add stuff like this

  could call it suffix rather then filename

- alternative: pass the whole filename down in option_string, savers parse
  again with filename_split

- PPM saver as well

- no, option_string is alreadyed used by "thumbnail", we need a new stabdard
  arg to detect and set ... how about "string_arguments"

  need to add this to ForeignSave so buffer and target can see it

  hide from introspection? eg. tag as DEPRECATED

- something in pytest is taking FOREVER ... find it and fix it

  uses enough memory to kill the laptop
